HOW TO PLAY:

The objective of this game is to guess the randomized 3, or 4 digit number.
You will be given X amount of tries depending on your difficulty level. 
After every try you will be given a hint. 
Under your guess there will be either a "*", "^", or just a blank space. 
The "*" symbolizes That number is in the sequence and it also in its proper placeing. 
The "^" symbolizes that number is in the sequence yet it is in the INCORRECT placing. 
If it is blank under the number that represents the number is not at all in the sequence. 
If you guess the number under the expected amount of tries you win, and also are asked to enter 
your name for the HighScore list, then asked if you want to play again or not. 
If you exceed the amount of tries you loos and are asked if you would like to play again. Good Luck and have fun!
