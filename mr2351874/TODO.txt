Mode = a set derived from another set which contains elements with a freq <= 2 and where freq is a max number

mode { 0,1,2 } = { null }
mode { 0,1,2,1 } = { 1 }
mode { 0,2,3,0,3 } = { 0 , 3 }
mode { 0,1,2,0,1,3 } = { 0, 3 }

1) steps sort the set
	{ 0, 0, 2, 3, 3 }
	   -2- -1- --2--
2) compare elements in set, with next element + count to fin max freq

3) another count to determine how many have max freq  #modes

4) create an array and fill with those that have max frequency

mode array = ma
ma[0] -> max freq
ma[1] -> # modes
ma[2] -> mode[1]
ma[3] -> mode[2]
ma[n+1 -> m[n-1]
