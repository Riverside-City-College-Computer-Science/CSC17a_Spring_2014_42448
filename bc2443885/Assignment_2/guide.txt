Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the 
unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy 
lies a small unregarded yellow sun. 
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 
ninety-two million miles is an utterly 
insignificant little blue green 
planet whose ape-descended life forms 
are so amazingly primitive that they 
still think digital watches are a 
pretty neat idea. 

This planet has - or rather had - a problem, 
which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for 
pretty much of the time. 
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, 
but most of these were largely 
concerned with the movements of 
small green pieces of paper, 
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't 
the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
 
And so the problem remained; 
lots of the people were mean, 
and most of them were miserable, 
even the ones with digital watches.
 
Many were increasingly of the opinion 
that they'd all made a big mistake 
in coming down from the trees 
in the first place. 
And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, 
and that no one should ever have left the oceans. 

And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years 
after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying 
how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, 
one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in 
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that 
had been going wrong all this time, 
and she finally knew how the world could be 
made a good and happy place. 
This time it was right, it would work, and no one 
would have to get nailed to anything. 

Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone 
to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe 
occurred, and the idea was lost forever. 

This is not her story. 
But it is the story of that terrible stupid 
catastrophe and some of its consequences. 
It is also the story of a book, 
a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy 
- not an Earth book, never published on Earth, 
and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, 
never seen or heard of by any Earthman. 

Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. 
in fact it was probably the most remarkable 
book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of 
Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard either.
 
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, 
it is also a highly successful one - more popular than the 
Celestial Home Care Omnibus, 
better selling than Fifty More Things 
to do in Zero Gravity, and more 
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy 
of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some 
More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
